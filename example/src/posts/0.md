Well, here it is! I decided that Wordpress wasn't quite right for what I do,
and the small amount of posts I get around to putting up each year. As a result
I've rebuilt my site to use [Hugo](http://hugo.spf13.com/) and [v3 of Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)! Pretty exciting,
if you ask me. But then again no one did ask me so...  
  
Over the new few weeks I hope to get everything moved over, and the rest of
this all working a bit better, so hang tight!
